Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning. Customer churn is when customers stop doing business with a company, which is a crucial metric for understanding business health and optimizing customer retention strategies. By analyzing patterns in historical data, the model can identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling the company to take proactive steps to retain them.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that classifies customers into two categories: Likely to Churn and Likely to Stay. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze customer data to understand key factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights.

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and scaling where necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are used to explore relationships between features and the target variable (churn).
Feature Engineering: Important features are selected based on correlations and domain knowledge.
Model Training and Evaluation: Multiple models are trained, with the Random Forest classifier chosen as the primary model due to its interpretability and performance.
Performance Metrics: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies the top features impacting customer churn, which can provide actionable insights.
Requirements
To run this project, install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Load and Preprocess Data: The data is loaded from a CSV file or a URL, with necessary preprocessing steps applied.
Train the Model: A Random Forest model is trained on the processed dataset.
Evaluate the Model: Performance metrics and visualizations (like confusion matrix and feature importance) are generated.
Make Predictions: Test the model with a sample customer record to predict churn probability.
Dataset
The dataset used is a public Telco Customer Churn dataset, which includes customer demographics, account information, and service usage data. Key attributes include:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Male or Female.
SeniorCitizen: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen.
Partner/Dependents: Indicates if the customer has a partner or dependents.
Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
Contract/Payment Method: Type of contract and payment method chosen by the customer.
MonthlyCharges/TotalCharges: Monthly and total charges billed to the customer.
Results and Insights
Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy in predicting churn, allowing the company to identify at-risk customers.
Top Influential Features: Factors such as Contract Type, Monthly Charges, and Total Charges are highly correlated with churn, providing insights into the main drivers behind customer churn.
Example Prediction
An example prediction is provided using a sample customer record to show the model's prediction on whether a customer is likely to churn.

Visualizations
Confusion Matrix: Shows the model's classification accuracy.
Feature Importance Plot: Highlights the top factors contributing to customer churn.
Future Enhancements
Potential improvements include:

Trying other machine learning algorithms for comparison (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
Implementing hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Exploring additional features or using synthetic data to improve predictions.
